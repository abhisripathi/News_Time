/* Strategic CSS Structure (global styles) */
/*Strategic CSS Structure:

We start with a global style reset using the asterisk (*) selector, 
ensuring consistent margins, paddings, and a uniform box-sizing across all elements.
The body is structured using flexbox, ensuring the main content grows to occupy the 
available space, and pushing the footer to the bottom.
We've also incorporated a clean sans-serif font, 'Open Sans', for a modern look.*/

.header, .footer {
    flex-shrink: 0;  /* Ensure they don't shrink */
}

/* Using Flexbox for the header and footer */
/*Flexbox:

The header and footer both employ flexbox. This provides a linear layout, 
placing the logo and navigation on opposite ends in the header.
The .flex-container has the justify-content: space-between property, 
ensuring that the child elements (logo and navigation) are spaced out evenly.
The navigation items use flexbox too, to lie horizontally next to each other.
For responsive design, when the screen size drops below 768px, these elements 
stack vertically for better readability on mobile devices.*/

/* Using CSS Grid for the main content area */
/*CSS Grid:

The main content area utilizes CSS Grid to define a two-column layout - \
one for main content and one for a sidebar. This is achieved with the 
grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr property, giving the content area twice the space 
as the sidebar.Again, in the name of responsiveness, on smaller screens, 
these columns stack, ensuring they're readable on mobile devices.*/

.grid-container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr;

    padding: 1rem;

    background-color: #ddd;
    padding: 1rem;
    position: relative;  /* To ensure the floated image behaves well within this container */
}

/* Using Floats for an image inside the sidebar */
/*Floats:

Inside our sidebar, we've used the float property for images, 
making them align to the right of their container. This creates a 
wrap-around effect where the text wraps around the floated images.
To prevent any unwanted layout behavior, a clearfix is used 
in the .sidebar, ensuring it doesn't collapse when it contains floated elements.*/

.float-img {
    float: right;
    margin-left: 10px;
    width: 50%;`

/* Clearfix to make sure the container doesn't collapse when containing floats */
.sidebar:after {
    content: "";
    display: table;

A roll over effect on images

In today's presentation, we'll explore a dynamic visual enhancement technique 
known as the 'rollover effect' for images on a webpage. This effect is achieved 
using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and provides an interactive experience for the user. 
When a user hovers over an image, the image undergoes a subtle transformation, increasing 
in size to 110% of its original dimensions and slightly fading in opacity to 80%. 
This transition is smoothly animated over 0.3 seconds, ensuring it's noticeable yet elegant. 
Implementing this effect involves the use of the CSS transition, transform, and hover properties. 
*/
img {
    transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out;  /* This will give a smooth transition effect */
}

img:hover {
    transform: scale(1.1);  /* Scales the image up to 110% of its original size */
    opacity: 0.8;          /* Reduces opacity to 80% */
}

/* A button that changes colors when clicked 

*/
.nav-button {
    background-color: #333;
    color: #fff;
    border: none;
    padding: 10px 20px;
    border-radius: 5px;
    cursor: pointer;
    transition: background-color 0.3s;
}

.nav-button:hover {
    background-color: #555;
}

.nav-button:active {
    background-color: #111;

/* Responsive Design with Flexbox (for smaller screens) */

Our design is adaptive. As the viewport decreases, our flex and grid layouts 
change to accommodate mobile users. This is achieved using a media query for 
screens with a maximum width of 768px.*/
